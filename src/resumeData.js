  "roleDescription": " During my 16-year career as a jeweler and gemologist, I was introduced to the beauty and power of software engineering while building and managing the company’s website and e-commerce site. This whet my appetite for solving problems using software and technology. I made a life-altering change when I became a Software Engineering student at Fullstack Academy, a top-ranked coding bootcamp--and I couldn’t love it more. I am currently a full stack software engineer specializing in React, Express, PostgreSQL, and Node.",
